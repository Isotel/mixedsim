# Hardware Design Tool - Mixed Signal Simulation with Verilog Project

Designing embedded applications typically involves analog and digital worlds, 
from simple micro-controllers, more comprehensive micro-controllers featuring 
programmable digital and analog logic, or it could refer to a new chip designs. 
To be able to verify the concepts we strive for simulation tools that could verify 
both worlds together, not only as a mixed-signal simulation but also to be able to 
include Verilog and other languages too. Such solutions are provided by commercial 
packages each having some benefits and drawbacks. Here we represent an open-source
free to use solution thanks to open-source projects which runs on all systems.
